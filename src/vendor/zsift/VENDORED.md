# Vendored: zsift

The CSV parser zscour reads files with. Copied from zarbor's vendored copy, so zscour has no
dependencies of any kind.

- Source: https://github.com/AstraLibernis/zsift
- Commit: `a0e581c27bb935edf1931dde9a7ca47e901c7636` (after zsift v0.4 milestone M5), copied 2026-09-29
- Licence: LGPL-3.0-or-later (zscour itself is GPL-3.0-or-later; LGPL code may be combined into it) (SPDX headers kept in every file)
- Copied: `src/csv.zig` (its `test { ... }` block removed: zsift's tests are not
  vendored) and every file in `src/core/`. Nothing else is changed.

## Refreshing

1. In a zsift checkout at the wanted commit, run `zig build test` and
   `zig build verify` (both must pass).
2. Replace `src/vendor/zsift/core/` with that checkout's `src/core/`, and
   `src/vendor/zsift/csv.zig` with its `src/csv.zig` minus the `test` block.
3. Update the commit above and run zarbor's `zig build test`. Then load real
   files with the previous and the refreshed zarbor and check the tables are
   identical (same `Frame` names, kinds, levels, value bits, unparsed counts)
   before trusting it.
